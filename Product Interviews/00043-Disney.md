# Problem

How would you improve how we serve content on ESPN ?

## Make it harder ? 

Assume you're improving the mobile app.

# Solution

This is a pretty straightforward Improve a Product question. Let's first go over the Improve a Product formula:

1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Identify users, behaviors, and pain points
3. State product goal
4. Brainstorm small improvements
5. Brainstorm bolder improvements
6. Measure success
7. Summarize

Now, let's begin!

## Ask clarifying questions

Before we begin listing off recommendations, it's important you ask questions to ensure you and the interviewer are on the same page. There's a few questions we may ask for this type of question.

 > Before we begin, I'd like to ask a few questions:
 
 > Are we looking to improve ESPN as a whole or a specific platform such as web or the mobile app?
   Do you define content as only news content or does this include information such as boxscores, videos, and player pages?

For this solution, let's assume we want to increase how News content is served on the mobile app. News content includes both written articles and news in video format. It does not include highlight videos, boxscores, player pages, or any other type of media.

## Identify users, behaviors, and pain points

Here we'll want to discuss the types of users using the app and go over any specifics that make them unique. Also, indicating their pain points here is useful in driving how you build your solutions.

> Since we're focusing on ESPN, it's safe to assume most our users are male. Though there may be a small segment of female users, it's more useful to define our male user audience so we can think of specific behaviors in this segment. It's likely our users are males between the ages of 20-55 and thus are likely to be more digitally savvy than other types of users.

> Their main pain points are finding relevant and high quality content. Especially with the proliferation of content creators on the web, it's now difficult to find the best content.

> Sports fans are fanatical and will consume content about their favorite teams and sports at all times of the day. That said, it's more likely users will consume content in the afternoon - aka when their teams are not playing. It's more likely for users to engage with the actual game when the games are playing than read news stories or watch news videos.

## State product goal

By going over the product and feature goal, we can hone in our solutions to focus on improving a single metric. This helps create focus our solution and keep from rambling about unnecessary features.

> ESPN's main goal is to be the premier sports app in the world. Content, specifically, is used to engage users and generate revenue. Since ESPN is an ads based business, the more content a user consumes the more ads they'll likely be served. Due to this, content's main goal is to drive stickiness and traffic to the app.

## Brainstorm small improvements

Starting off with smaller improvements shows you're capable of executing regardless of resources. Moving the needle with what are viewed as more unsexy features are critical in any PM's career.

> I'd like to start by offering a few small improvements we could make to the app experience to increase content consumption.

> First, I'd look at how we serve push notifications. Optimizing the content of the notification with rich media, as well as optimizing the time of sends to the lunch hour or around happy hour can increase usage as users are more likely to engage in content during the lunch hour or after work on their commute home. By serving timely notifications we can capture our user's attention when they're least likely to be on the app since there's typically less games on during the day.
  
> Another smaller improvement I'd make is in the design of each news card on the News feed. Making each card more concise with more relevant information such as team or sport details can help users identify useful content from browsing. This would increase CTR on each piece of content and increase the chance a user engages with the content.
  
> Lastly, I'd look at adding more of ESPN's written content in the news feed. Right now, ESPN is primarily pushing it's video content, but it may be less digestible than written content depending on the time of day. I'd look at splitting the amount of Written to Video content to be a 2:1 split to help quicker consumption of content via written content.

## Brainstorm bolder improvements

Now, let's propose a bold idea. A PM's job is to offer both small and incremental solutions, as well as bold ideas. Show the interviewer you're capable of both.

> I'd also like to propose a bolder idea that I think could really increase content engagement. This may require more resources so if the resources aren't there we can still implement our smaller improvements.

> Right now, you're able to log into ESPN and see your friends, but you're unable to actually interact with them. I'd recommend a way to quickly share or DM pieces of content to your friends. This could be as simple as adding a tray to the content stream with your friends to send them content. It would send as a push notification and use your own name in the push notification.

> A feature like this would increase clickthrough rate of push notifications since the content is being shared by a friend. Furthermore, this outsources the sharing of new content within friend groups which limits the number of notifications we'd need to send.

> Creating a social element around the sharing of content is also inline with sports fandom. These users are often looking to be the first to break the news of exciting content and this feature can help spur more virality around our content. A feature like this also is flexible to allow for more intentional conversations around sports through a proprietary messaging system in the future.

## Measuring success

An important aspect of being a product manager is evaluating your own features' success. Due to this, we need to make sure we talk about different metrics we'd use to measure the success of our implementation. Be specific here.

> The main goal of our content is to increase engagement on our mobile app (thus leading to increased revenue from ads). Because of this, we should look at metrics that directly measure engagement. For our smaller improvements I'd look at clickthrough rate of each mechanism, so push notification CTR and news card CTR. If these improvements are successful, CTR should increase.

> For our bolder sharing solution, I'd look at metrics such as number of articles shared, push notification CTR, and content retention. If this feature is successful, there should be a high number of shared content leading to a higher than average CTR. These things, alongside high quality content, should lead to a better user experience.

## Summarize

Be concise when you summarize your solution. The key is to keep it between 15 to 30 seconds in length.

> ESPN is an important app in the Disney suite, with its goal being to be the premier sports app in the world. One critical piece of the ESPN product is its content since it creates a more engaging app and generates revenue through ads. If I were to improve how ESPN serves content I'd look at optimizing push notifications, content cards, and adding more written content to news feeds. A bolder idea would be to add article sharing between friends. To measure the success of these features, I'd primarily look at clickthrough rates and content retention.
